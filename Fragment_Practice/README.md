#Fragment Practice
This exercise explores the difference between an Activity and Fragment. A secondary goal to this exercise is to have the application display content differently base on the orientation (portrait and horizontal).

__Portrait mode behavior__

* Activity has one fragment that handles character selection
* Clicking on character image launch a new Activity with another fragment to display character info

__Landscape mode behavior__

* left side runs the character selection fragment
* right side runs the character info fragment
* when the character image gets click the right fragment update to show info about character
